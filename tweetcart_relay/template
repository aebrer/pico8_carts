What is a Tweetcart Relay?:

Basically we receive a tweetcart as a 1/1 (or whatever tbh) from a friend, and we modify it to make our own tweetcart, which we then send to someone else, to continue the process. Eventually it's our hope to have many relay chains going on with many people, anyone at all who likes to make tweetcarts or wants to learn how :) . Tweetcarts must have their source code fit within one tweet.

Explanation:
```
_set_fps(60)
-- set some functions to save chars
r=rnd
p=srand
q=poke
-- global context needed
f=0g=0v=128
-- set seed, r(-1) is random from all possible numbers
s=r(-1)p(s)
-- how many colors to use in this piece
c=r(12)%1+4
-- enable sspr to read the display
q(0x5f54,0x60)
cls()  -- clear screen
for i=0,16do pal(i,r(17)-33,1)end  -- randomize palette
::_::  -- start loop
for i=0,80do  -- 80 gets us a nice circle, 800 is a THICK circle
x=64+cos(g/v+i/80)*64y=64+sin(i/80-g/v)*60  -- set x and y, this is mostly Alex's doing
?line(x-r(6),y+r(6),f%c)  -- use a line, from last line call to this one, which makes a wiggly circle
end
g+=r(.3)  -- increase g by a random (entropy locked) amount
if(r()>.4)f+=.5p(s)sspr(1,1,126,126,0,0,v,v)  -- lazy entropy locking calibrated to trigger often, tied to the color cycling and the sspr call
goto _  -- draw loop
```

To Friends and Creators:
Want to change the code, or make a relay Tweetcart of yourself based on this one? No problem!
