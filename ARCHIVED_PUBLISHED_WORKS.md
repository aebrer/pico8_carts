## Notes

- ⭐ = Personal favorite
- ⭐⭐ = "fucking love this one"
- Some fxhash folder contents may not have been published on fxhash (development/testing)
- Links to be added as they're confirmed
- Published dates and specific platform URLs need verification

## TODO

- [ ] Add direct links to all published works
- [ ] Verify which fxhash folders were actually published
- [ ] Document Tweetcart Token series details
- [ ] Add publication dates where available
- [ ] Verify platform for The Trace (itch.io?)
- [ ] Confirm Petite Chute publication platform
- [ ] Map art4artists pieces to their publication venues
