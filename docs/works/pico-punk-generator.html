            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This is the original pico_punks generator. Heavily inspired by Max Capacity's dos_punks, I wanted to see if I could create something similar on the Pico-8 Fantasy Console‚Äîfully procedural avatar generation using nothing but code.</p>

            <p>All the features are programmatically generated. There are no images, no sprites, no pre-rendered components. Everything is made by stacking Pico-8's built-in characters over and over. Nothing but text is being displayed on the screen, composed into faces through procedural generation and completed by your brain through pareidolia.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Interactive Controls</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Left/Right</strong>: Navigate seeds (-/+ 1)</li>
              <li><strong>Down/Up</strong>: Jump through seed space (-/+ 10)</li>
              <li><strong>üÖæÔ∏è button</strong>: Random seed</li>
              <li><strong>‚ùé button</strong>: Save a downloadable image</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If you have synced your wallet, the generator starts on a pico_punk based on your wallet address seed‚Äîyour unique starting point in the infinite space</li>
              <li>Rare combinations and special features including 1/1000 rainbow mode</li>
              <li>Procedural hair, eyes, skin tones, mouths, eyepatches, beards, and more</li>
              <li>Pure Lua code running in Pico-8‚Äîview source to see how it works</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Series Evolution</h3>
            <p>This first generator explored the space of what's possible with procedural generation on heavily constrained hardware. Each punk is isolated: one seed, one process, one output.</p>

            <p>Over time this evolved into <a href="pico-punk-generator-generator.html">pico_punk_generator_generator.p8</a>, where the curator isn't just choosing from infinite punks‚Äîthe process of exploration itself modifies the output. That final version was featured in the <a href="https://janogallery.com/collections/digital-self" target="_blank">"Digital Self"</a> exhibition at Jano Lapin Gallery (September-November 2022).</p>

            <p>What began as satire became identity. My profile picture across platforms is now a pico_punk‚Äînot just a representation of identity, but constitutive of it.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Author's Notes</h3>
            <p><em>This is the generator for my pico_punks. I was heavily inspired by Max Capacity's dos_punks to see if I could create something similar on the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. I had a ton of fun making this, and I hope you have a ton of fun looking through the generated space.</em></p>
