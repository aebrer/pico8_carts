            <p><em>This piece is part of the <a href="https://teia.art/marblez.tez" target="_blank">marblez project</a> by @jmh_wwyg - "digital fantazy marblez" created in Game Maker Studio with retro PSX-esque graphics. You can move the marble around and check out the properties and objects stored inside. A lot of them have secret properties, and this one is no exception. Try viewing it at specific times.</em></p>

            <p><em>The concept (for me) was that the marble is almost like a standard weight for a quantified unit of Dead God Pulse energy/frequency. But as you can see, the marble is cracked, and maybe containment isn't as reliable as the Foundation imagined.</em></p>

            <p><em>This is a secret member of the vestiges series - we forgot to tag it on release, so it's never been officially categorized until now.</em></p>

            <p><em>I had to create the looping gif(s), ensure perfect loops, make multiple versions (one relates to the time-based secret), and coordinate with @jmh_wwyg's technical requirements for the Game Maker integration. They did incredible work with the planar mapping to give my flat 2D gifs a 3D presence in the final piece.</em></p>

            <p><em>The source code for my contribution is lost - these were transient gifs like in Local Ontology Secured Transistor, created specifically for this collaboration and not preserved separately.</em></p>

        <p>This is strange. This vestige wasn't in the catalog I was provided. Cross-referencing the timestamp (2021) with known containment protocols—marble-based measurement systems were phased out in late 2021 when the Foundation shifted to direct GDGP field monitoring. Marble units were deemed unreliable after the Libra Incident.</p>

        <p>But here's one that escaped documentation. The crack is visible in the archived imagery. If this marble was serving as a measurement standard, and the crack compromised containment integrity, then every GDGP reading calibrated against this unit would be suspect.</p>

        <p>The "secret member" status is accurate—no vestiges_of_the_dead_god tag in the original metadata. It exists in a collaboration project outside Foundation oversight. The time-dependent properties mentioned by Researcher Brereton align with known Dead God Pulse temporal anomalies.</p>

        <p>Question: If marble-based containment was abandoned because it proved unreliable, why does this one still exist in accessible form? And what does it contain at those specific times?</p>

        <!-- arc_9f2b4e11: uncatalogued vestige. marble containment deprecated 2021. crack compromises calibration integrity. temporal properties documented but mechanism unexplained. collaboration exists outside Foundation documentation chain. -->
