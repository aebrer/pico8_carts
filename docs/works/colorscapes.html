            <p>COLORSCAPES is a cellular automata, where all the rules for movement and color have been converted to random events. This should produce nonsense, but by adding Entropy Locking, we see each seed acting as a "genotype" creating emergent rules and cool visuals. The original base for this was the same WFC algo that I was using in my previous pieces... but after many refactors for performance almost none of the original remains.</p>

            <p>This is a screensaver, so it's best enjoyed at fullscreen and left to run for some time.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Author's Notes</h3>
            <p><em>These screensaver pieces all played with and evolved from different applications or mutations of the same core algorithms. This one really demonstrates the specific means the colors use to propagate, which I like a lot. Plus a lot of the outputs look like mountains, both on a map and/or a landscape.</em></p>
