            <h3>Statement</h3>
            <p>I am driven by a fascination with Entropy, how it exists in every system, natural or artificial, and how humans perceive it.</p>

            <p>With pico_punks, this concept is explored in a few ways. As the user moves through the generative space, extremely random events build up on the screen, until eventually a face is perceived clearly. The ability of the human brain to perceive faces out of noise is endlessly impressive, and a central theme of the pico_punks project.</p>

            <p>When the user moves away from this newly discovered pico_punk, unless they took a screenshot, it is gone forever. Even in the unlikely event that they could perfectly recreate the steps they took to create it, they would find that minor deviations change the pico_punk; these might be subjective improvements, or they might be worse, but the irreversibility of the process means that they will never be seen again.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Controls</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> - Move through the generative space (consistent positioning: up then down returns to start)</li>
              <li><strong>‚ùé button (X)</strong> - Take a high-resolution screenshot for exporting</li>
              <li><strong>üÖæÔ∏è button (O)</strong> - Clear the screen, resetting the display for the current position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Exhibition History</h3>
            <p>This piece was included in <a href="https://janogallery.com/collections/digital-self" target="_blank"><strong>"Digital Self"</strong></a>, a physical gallery exhibition at Jano Lapin Gallery in Verdun, Quebec (September 22 - November 16, 2022).</p>

            <p>The exhibition, co-curated by Samuel Arsenault-Brassard and Anne Jano, explored digital identity through 36 international artists. The curatorial theme examined how digital technologies enable people to create "anonymous, false, playful, alternate, and selected identities," asking: <em>"what would the portrait of these digital selves resemble?"</em></p>

            <p>pico_punks answered that question directly‚Äînot with a fixed portrait, but with a tool for creating identity through interactive exploration and co-authorship with generative systems.</p>
