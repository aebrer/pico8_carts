        <p>Interactive generative systems as lofi Rorschach tests with an SCP Foundation-esque twist.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Ideocart generators are explorable, interactive systems. As you navigate through them, you inevitably "see things" in the patterns—faces, creatures, structures, entities. This is pareidolia by design.</p>

        <p>Common sightings: faces, monsters, gods, temples, statues, giant mechs and kaijus, strange machines beyond human comprehension.</p>

        <p>The fiction: some of these things might be seeing you back.</p>

        <p>Think of it as an alternative world's psychological testing apparatus, where finding meaning in randomness isn't a bug—it's the entire point. And maybe, just maybe, something on the other side is taking notes.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>On the name:</strong> "Ideocartography" combines two concepts. First, the practice of mapping ideas—exploring a landscape composed of thoughts from higher dimensions or realities, noting what you find. Hence, "ideo" (idea) "cartography" (mapping). Second, "cart" refers to these being lofi cartridges, like game console carts that slot into a Pico-8 (which exists as physical hardware in this fiction).</p>
