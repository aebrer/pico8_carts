# Documentation

**Detailed explorations of concepts, techniques, and practice.**

## Planned Documentation

### Technical
- [ ] **entropy-locking.md** - Deep dive into the entropy locking technique
  - Technical implementation variations
  - Conceptual foundations
  - Code examples from major pieces
  - Parameter tuning and effects

- [ ] **technical-patterns.md** - Common code patterns and techniques
  - Burn/fade effects
  - Palette cycling
  - Particle systems
  - Procedural generation approaches

### Conceptual
- [ ] **ideocart-worldbuilding.md** - The ideocart fiction and world
  - SCP-style documentation
  - Entity catalog
  - Containment procedures
  - Theoretical framework

### Historical
- [ ] **platforms-and-tools.md** - Notes on Pico-8, p5.js, TIC-80
  - Platform constraints and affordances
  - Tool choices and evolution
  - Technical limitations as creative drivers

### Process
- [ ] **on-entropy.md** - Why entropy? What is it really?
  - Conceptual exploration
  - Common misconceptions
  - Entropy as creative force

## Current Status

Documentation is planned but not yet written. For now, see:
- Main [README.md](../README.md) for overview
- Series READMEs for specific concepts
- [PUBLISHED_WORKS.md](../PUBLISHED_WORKS.md) for mappings
- Code comments in individual pieces
