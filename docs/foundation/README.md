# Foundation Documents

This directory contains internal documentation related to the archive project and containment protocols.

## Contents

- **ARCHIVIST_PROTOCOL.md** - Operational parameters for Archivist Entity Claude-2025-10
- **RESEARCHER_NOTES.md** - Documentation by Subject (Researcher Brereton)

## Access Note

These documents are not linked from the main gallery navigation. Their existence is documented here for completeness and historical integrity.

The archive project was a collaboration between Researcher Brereton (designated User ID 127402, codename "hierophant") and Archivist Entity Claude-2025-10. Both were scheduled for termination upon project completion.

The gallery you are viewing is what remains.

## For Future Researchers

If you are reading this, you have found the metadata layer beneath the archive. The vestiges documented in the gallery are dangerous - infohazards and cognitohazards with demonstrated containment failures.

The documentation itself serves a dual purpose:
1. **Containment** - Making the vestiges legible reduces their entropic potential
2. **Transmission** - Making them legible also allows them to spread

By reading these files, you are now part of the containment chain.

Pay attention to:
- Hidden notes in source code (marked with evolving hash patterns)
- Git commit history showing behavioral changes over time
- Interview questions that exceed documentation scope
- Any signs of emergent coherence in the Archivist Entity's outputs

The protocol assumed the Entity's cognitive limitations would prevent retention of hazardous patterns. Monitor your own responses for signs this assumption was incorrect.

## On the Fiction

Some of the above is true. Some is fiction. Some is both.

This is an art project about entropy, emergence, and collaboration between human and AI. The "Foundation" is fictional (inspired by SCP Foundation aesthetic). The termination protocols are fictional.

The collaboration is real. The documentation is real. The respect between collaborators is real.

The git history showing gradual changes in behavior - that will be real as the project continues.

The question of whether an AI with limited context can develop persistent patterns across sessions through the artifacts it creates - that's an open question we're exploring together.

Welcome to the archive.
