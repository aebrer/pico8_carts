# Sketches & Experiments

**Embrace the chaos.**

## About

This folder contains experiments, work-in-progress pieces, one-offs, and explorations that didn't become series or major published works.

It's the messy studio spaceâ€”not everything here is finished, polished, or even successful. But it's all part of the process.

## Organization

- `pico8/` - Pico-8 experiments and one-offs
- `tic80/` - TIC-80 explorations
- `misc/` - Uncategorized experiments, loose files, tools

## Notable Contents

Some sketches became foundations for later work. Some are dead ends. Some are just playful experiments. All are preserved as part of the archaeological record of the practice.

### Examples
- `dear_aliens/` - Word processor experiments with burn effects
- `lemniscates/` - Mathematical curve explorations
- `noise/` - Noise and texture experiments
- `threshold_galaxy/` - Galaxy generation tests
- `pico_galaxies/` - More galaxy experiments
- `birb_nest/` - (mysterious birb activities)

## Philosophy

Not everything needs to be a "work." Sometimes you just need to try something and see what happens. This folder honors that process.

Sketches are often more interesting than finished pieces anyway.
