# Screensavers Series

> **Note:** This README contains AI-generated interpretations based on code analysis. Content awaiting validation by human author.

**Concept:** Ambient generative pieces designed to run indefinitely—visual explorations meant for contemplation and background presence.

## About

The screensavers series creates generative visual experiences that evolve slowly over time. Unlike goal-driven pieces or interactive explorations, these are meant to exist in peripheral vision—calming, mesmerizing, endlessly variable.

## Works in This Series

### Published
- **[VISIONS](https://entropist.ca/works/visions.html)** (Teia, 2024) ⭐ - Ambient visual generation with entropy locking and WFC
- **[THE FALL](https://entropist.ca/works/the-fall.html)** (fxhash Base, 2024) ⭐ - Cascade and landscape generation, onchain storage
- **[Petite Chute](https://entropist.ca/works/petite-chute.html)** (Objkt, 2024) ⭐ - 16x16 pixel grid, derivative of THE FALL
- **[Deja Hue](https://entropist.ca/works/deja-hue.html)** (Manifold/Arweave, 2024) ⭐ - Destroyed cellular automata for color exploration

### Unpublished
- **Colorscapes** ⭐ - Color field explorations (WIP)
- **ssvr01** - Early screensaver experiment

## Technical Approach

Common features across screensavers:
- Designed for indefinite runtime
- Smooth, gradual evolution
- Often entropy-locked for controlled drift
- Minimal or no user interaction
- Palette-focused aesthetics
- Suitable for display/installation contexts

## Themes

- **Ambient Presence** - Designed to exist in the background
- **Slow Time** - Evolution measured in minutes and hours
- **Color as Subject** - Palette exploration and drift
- **Meditative Quality** - Contemplative rather than dramatic
- **Infinite Variation** - Never quite repeats

## Relationship to Broader Practice

The screensavers connect to:
- **Entropy Locking** - Especially Petite Chute and Deja Hue
- **Emergence** - Simple rules creating endless variety
- **Constraint** - Working within ambient/non-intrusive bounds
