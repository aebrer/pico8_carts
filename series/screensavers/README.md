# Screensavers Series

> **Note:** This README contains AI-generated interpretations based on code analysis. Content awaiting validation by human author.

**Concept:** Ambient generative pieces designed to run indefinitely—visual explorations meant for contemplation and background presence.

## About

The screensavers series creates generative visual experiences that evolve slowly over time. Unlike goal-driven pieces or interactive explorations, these are meant to exist in peripheral vision—calming, mesmerizing, endlessly variable.

## Works in This Series

### Published
- **VISIONS** ⭐ - Ambient visual generation
- **Colorscapes** ⭐ - Color field explorations
- **Deja Hue** (published as "deja_roux") ⭐ - Color drift and recurrence

### Unpublished
- **Petite Chute** (working title: o4o3) ⭐ - Entropy-locked cascade, p5.js
- **ssvr01** - Early screensaver experiment

## Technical Approach

Common features across screensavers:
- Designed for indefinite runtime
- Smooth, gradual evolution
- Often entropy-locked for controlled drift
- Minimal or no user interaction
- Palette-focused aesthetics
- Suitable for display/installation contexts

## Themes

- **Ambient Presence** - Designed to exist in the background
- **Slow Time** - Evolution measured in minutes and hours
- **Color as Subject** - Palette exploration and drift
- **Meditative Quality** - Contemplative rather than dramatic
- **Infinite Variation** - Never quite repeats

## Relationship to Broader Practice

The screensavers connect to:
- **Entropy Locking** - Especially Petite Chute and Deja Hue
- **Emergence** - Simple rules creating endless variety
- **Constraint** - Working within ambient/non-intrusive bounds

*These pieces are meant to be left running. Start one and forget about it for a while.*
