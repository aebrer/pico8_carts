# Ideocart Series

**Concept:** Interactive generative systems as lofi Rorschach tests with an SCP Foundation-esque twist.

## The Fiction

Ideocart generators are explorable, interactive systems. As you navigate through them, you inevitably "see things" in the patterns—faces, creatures, structures, entities. This is pareidolia by design.

The fiction: some of these things might be seeing you back.

Think of it as an alternative world's psychological testing apparatus, where finding meaning in randomness isn't a bug—it's the entire point. And maybe, just maybe, something on the other side is taking notes.

### Unpublished

## Technical Approach

The ideocart pieces typically feature:
- Interactive exploration (mouse/keyboard navigation)
- Procedural generation with fixed seeds
- Pareidolia-inducing patterns
- Minimal UI to maintain immersion
- Often: entropy locking for structured chaos

## Themes

- **Pareidolia** - The human tendency to see patterns
- **Surveillance** - The gaze goes both ways
- **Containment** - SCP-style documentation aesthetics
- **Emergence** - Complex meaning from simple rules
- **Ambiguity** - What's real? What's projection?
