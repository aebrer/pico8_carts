# Three Body Problem Series

> **Note:** This series already has an excellent README in the ThreeBodyProblem/ folder. When reorganization is complete, that README will be preserved here.

**Concept:** Physics simulation exploring n-body orbital mechanics, chaos theory, and emergent patterns in gravitational systems.

## About

A 24+ piece series published on hicetnunc (now viewable on objkt.com) that evolved from experimental chaos to refined, elegant motion.

The series explores what happens when you simulate multiple bodies under mutual gravitational attraction. Sometimes you get stable orbits. Sometimes you get beautiful spirals. Sometimes everything flies apart. You never quite know until you run the simulation.

## Highlights

- **NULL. 2body** - The precursor (stable two-body system)
- **experimental** - Early chaos exploration
- **death spiral** - When orbits decay
- **nothing lasts** - Impermanence in motion
- **I love you Mom** - Personal dedication
- **Titan** - Culmination piece with particularly pure, simple aesthetics ‚≠ê

## Technical Evolution

The series shows clear technical and aesthetic evolution:
- Early pieces: Experimental, chaotic, exploratory
- Middle pieces: Finding patterns, refining motion
- Later pieces: Clean, elegant, distilled
- **Titan**: Peak simplicity and beauty
