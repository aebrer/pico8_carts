# Emergence Series

**Concept:** Cross-platform exploration of emergent systems—complex patterns arising from simple rules.

## About

The emergence series explores how simple generative rules can produce complex, unexpected, beautiful behavior. This is emergence: when the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.

## Series Timeline

1. **emergence** (fxhash) - Initial exploration
2. **emergence II** (fxhash) - Refinement and evolution
3. **emergence III** (tweetcart token) - Constrained code version
4. **emergence IV** (fxhash) - Further development
5. **emergence V** (`tootcarts/emergence_V.p8`) - Mastodon/fediverse release

## Note on Emergence III

Emergence III was released as part of the Tweetcart Token Club—a constrained code piece fitting within tweet-length limits. It exists somewhere in the tweetcart archives but may not have a standalone file in this repo.

## Cross-Platform Nature

This series demonstrates how the same conceptual core can be expressed across different platforms and constraints:
- **fxhash** - Full-featured generative art platform
- **Tweetcarts** - Extreme constraint (280 characters of code)
- **Tootcarts** - Mastodon/fediverse audience

Each platform shapes the expression but the core idea persists: simple rules → complex behavior.

## Themes

- **Emergence** - Complexity from simplicity
- **Cellular Automata** - Often Conway's Game of Life or variants
- **Self-Organization** - Systems finding their own structure
- **Unpredictability** - You set the rules, but can't predict outcomes
- **Beauty in Math** - Aesthetic emergent from mathematical rules

## Technical Approaches

Common techniques across the series:
- Cellular automata
- Particle systems
- Agent-based models
- Rule-based generation
- Iterative evolution

*Emergence is a core theme throughout the entire practice—this series makes it explicit.*
