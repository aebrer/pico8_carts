# Pico Punks Series

**Concept:** Generative character/avatar systems exploring on-chain identity and procedural generation.

## About

The Pico Punks series creates generative avatars and characters using Pico-8's constrained platform. Part homage to CryptoPunks, part exploration of procedural character generation, part experiment in generative identity systems.

## The Meta-Generator

**pico_punk_generator_generator.p8** ⭐

The crown jewel [TODO: we'll work on this language later, reduce hubris] of this series—a generator that generates generators. A meta-system for creating pico_punk generators. This piece explores recursion and generative systems at multiple levels.

## Published Works (fxhash)

### Pico Punks Final Form
The definitive release of the pico punks system. Refined, polished, ready for minting.

### Uncurated Pico Punks
Raw, unfiltered output. All variations, no curation. A more democratic approach to generative avatars.

### pXco pXnks
An experimental variant with modified rules and aesthetics.

## Archive

The `2022/` folder contains earlier iterations, experiments, and PNG outputs from the development process. Preserved for historical/reference purposes.

## Technical Approach

Typical pico punk features:
- Layered sprite generation
- Trait-based systems (hair, eyes, accessories, etc.)
- Color palette variations
- Rarity mechanics
- Deterministic generation from seeds
- Export to PNG for on-chain use

## Themes

- **On-chain Identity** - Avatars living on the blockchain
- **Procedural Personality** - Character from code
- **Constraint as Style** - Pico-8's limits create distinctive aesthetic
- **Homage & Remix** - Reference to punk/pixel art culture
- **Generative Ownership** - Unique outputs from simple rules

## Relationship to Broader Practice

The punks series connects to:
- **Emergence** - Complex characters from simple trait systems
- **Constraint** - Pico-8 platform limitations as creative force
- **Identity** - What makes a generated thing "unique"?
